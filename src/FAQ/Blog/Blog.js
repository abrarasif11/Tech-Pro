				<p className="px-4 py-6 pt-0 ml-4 -mt-4 dark:text-gray-400">Cross-origin resource sharing is a mechanism that allows a way for web pages to access API or assets running on a different restricted domain.Today, we’ll explore CORS in-depth and learn how to activate it on different front-end frameworks. 
                It is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources. CORS also relies on a mechanism by which browsers make a "preflight" request to the server hosting the cross-origin resource, in order to check that the server will permit the actual request. In that preflight, the browser sends headers that indicate the HTTP method and headers that will be used in the actual request.</p>

                <p className="px-4 py-6 pt-0 ml-4 -mt-4 dark:text-gray-400">Firebase is a free service that lets users log in with their Google account. Firebase is a good choice if you plan to either write a brand-new application or rewrite an existing one from scratch. Additionally, Firebase helps in the easy storing and retrieval of dynamic content. If you decide to develop the application without any form of custom coding the backend, Firebase makes this easy. Firebase is also serverless which means that Firebase runs on the cloud and you don’t need a physical server that’s constantly running.

				<p className="px-4 py-6 pt-0 ml-4 -mt-4 dark:text-gray-400">The react private route component renders a route component if the user is logged in and in an authorised role for the route, if the user isn’t logged in they’re redirected to the /login page, if the user is logged in but aren’t in an authorised role they’re redirected to the home page. </p>

                    <p>Node.js is the JavaScript runtime environment which is based on Google’s V8 Engine i.e. with the help of Node.js we can run the JavaScript outside of the browser. Other things that you may or may not have read about Node.js is that it is single-threaded, based on event-driven architecture, and non-blocking based on the I/O model.</p>
